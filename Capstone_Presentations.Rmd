## Executive Summary

This Project is part of Coursera - John Hopkins Data Science Specialization Course on Swiftkey Capstone Project.

This Project is about predicting/suggesting next text/word based on the given text/sentences, like popular phone Swiftkey Smart Keyboard.

The N-Gram result was already summarized from Task02 Project based on collections of 3 training datasets, en_US.blogs.txt,en_US.twitter.txt and en_US.news.txt which then pre-processed to be N-Gram tables.

**Algorithm Steps :**

1.  Data Collections from News,Blogs and Twitter and Data Cleaning

2.  NLP Analysis to produce n-Gram, in this project we will use mono,bi and tri-Gram to predict up to 2 word predictors

3.  Generate 5 highest frequency n-gram

4.  Filter up to 2 words input to predict 2nd/3rd words based on 5 highest likelihood

5.  System View

## Data Collections and Data Cleaning

Below are the steps of Data Collections and Data Cleaning

-   Import Data From the given sources,ie Twitter, blogs and news

-   Data Cleaning and transform to word corpus, which consists of remove unnecessary characters, remove punctuation, remove numbers, transform to lowercase and text stemming

-   Below are sample output of Top 20 Monogram, Bigram and Trigram respectively

-   This results will be used to predict/recommend next words based on 2 last word predictors

```{r image, out.width = "30%"}
library(knitr)
include_graphics(c("monogram.png","bigram.png","trigram.png"))
```

## Filtering, Predictions Result and Limitations

Predictions will be made based on the mono,bi and tri-gram tables from the given input predictors

Below are project limitations and limitations could be further enhanced as per required.

-   Training data was limited to 7500 rows to avoid memory overload issues

-   Predictors are limited to max last 2 words

-   Output predictions will be limited to 5 predictions based on highest likelihood

## System View

Below are graphical interface on shiny apps

-   System will consider last 2 words as predictors

-   Predictions will be shown on the left panes

-   Right most predictions is the highest likelihood

-   Left most predictions is the least likelihood

```{r out.width = "70%"}
library(knitr)
include_graphics(c("gui.png"))
```
